# MovieLens User Engagement Predictor

A machine learning model that predicts user engagement on the MovieLens platform based on rating behavior. This project uses logistic regression to classify users as engaged or non-engaged by analyzing features like:

- Number of ratings submitted
- Average rating score
- Duration of user activity

The model achieves good predictive performance with cross-validation and includes visualization tools for model evaluation (correlation heatmaps, ROC curves, confusion matrices). It can be used to predict engagement likelihood for new users with different usage profiles.

Built with Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.
## Dataset

This project uses the [MovieLens dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?resource=download&select=ratings.csv), which can be downloaded from Kaggle.
